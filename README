AuthlogicDRC
============

AuthlogicDRC is a DRC (DeRose Connect) add-on for the Authlogic authentication system.

This extension requires the DRCClient gem and a working DRC server with which it will communicate for authentication.  You can get this plugin at http://github.com/dwaynemac/drc_client.

When using this extension, calls to persist your Authlogic session should work seamlessly, such as:

UserSession.find

You will need to add a session persistence before_filter in your controller like

before_filter DRCClient.filter

 or

before_filter DRCClient.filter(:gateway => true)

to set current_drc_user for use with this add-on.
